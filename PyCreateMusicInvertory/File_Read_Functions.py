        encountered while reading the file. The values it can take are '\r', '\n', '\r\n', None (unknown, no newlines read yet)
         or a tuple containing all the newline types seen, to indicate that multiple newline conventions were encountered. For 
         files not opened in universal newline read mode the value of this attribute will be None.

        softspace
        Boolean that indicates whether a space character needs to be printed before another value when using the 
        print statement. Classes that are trying to simulate a file object should also have a writable softspace attribute, 
        which should be initialized to zero. This will be automatic for most classes implemented in Python (care may be needed 
        for objects that override attribute access); types implemented in C will have to provide a writable softspace attribute.
        Note: This attribute is not used to control the print statement, but to allow the implementation of print to keep track 
        of its internal state.
